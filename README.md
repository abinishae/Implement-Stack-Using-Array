# Implement-Stack-Using-Array
The stack here is implemented by an array stack[], and maxSize of the stack is 100000. If a push operation is performed beyond this size, you must print "Stack Full"(without quotes). Similarly, an unsuccessful pop operation should print "Stack Empty"(without quotes).  If a display operation is performed on an empty stack print -1.
